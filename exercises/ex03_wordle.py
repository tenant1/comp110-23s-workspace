"""
The purpose of this function is when given two strings, the 
first of any length, the second a single character, it will 
return True if the single character of the second string is
 found at any index of the first string, and return False 
 elsewhere.

 Parameters:
 word: string that is being searched through for the second 
 parameter
 character: string that is expected to be a single character
 in length and is the character being searched for 

 Returns:
 boolean denoting True if character is contained in string 
 or False if character is not contained in string

The purpose of this function is if given two strings of equal
